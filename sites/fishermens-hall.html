		 <h3>Original Text</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The image to the right is a snapshot of an advertisement for an event taking place at the Fishermen's Hall, which appeared in the Morning Chronicle of September 2nd, 1865.</p>		
		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Of the places detailed in this project, the Fishermen's Hall is the only building which remains exact, and for that reason, is the only site whose exact location can be definitively identified. Built in 1860-1861, the Fishermen's Hall is one of the few buildings in the down-town core of St. John's which escaped the Great Fire of 1892.  One possible reason for this is that the building is made from stone, and the majority of building destroyed in fire were made of wood and so burned easily and quickly.  This fact was not lost on the people of St. John's, and the rebuilding of the downtown which followed the Great Fire was focused on the use of stone or brick instead of wood, in order to avoid such quick destruction in future times (cite).</p>

         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p>The preservation of the Fishermen's hall is extraordinary, given its historical context, and in 1985 it received the Southcott Award for Building Restoration/Preservation, given by the Newfoundland and Labrador Historic Trust. (cite).</p>
         <p>The Fishermen's Hall was originall built as an exhibition hall for fisheries and agricultural produce. It also became a popular location for other social events, including dances, lectures, and theatre, and was even used as a Catholic place of worship and as the Sisters of Mercy Catholic school.</p>
