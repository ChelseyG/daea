      <h1>Gebelein</h1>
         <h2>Pre-Dynastic to Middle Kingdom</h2>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>During the Napoleonic expeditions to Egypt in the early nineteenth century, preliminary
		 recordings of sites were noted in the now-famous manuscript, D’escription de L’Egypte. One
		 of these sites was Gebelein, the remains of a settlement from the pre-dynastic era all the
		 way to the Middle Kingdom. Along with other sites such as Abydos and Hierakonpolis, 
		 Gebelein featured a rich variety of archaeological finds, from mummies to a pleated dress.
		 Like other sites discovered and excavated during the nineteenth century, artifacts and 
		 human remains brought to Europe and exhibited in museums educated the public, and brought 
		 awareness to Egyptology.</p>
          <br>
         <h3>Location and Geographical Setting</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Gebelein, also known as Gebelên, is located approximately 32 km (~20 miles) south of
		 Thebes in Upper Egypt, along the western side of the Nile River, in a place currently 
		 known as Naga el-Gherira (Oxford Reference) (Bard, 402). The name Gebelein is Arabic for 
		 “the two mountains”, and was influenced by the two hills surrounding the site – Gebelein 
		 is located on the slopes of the southern hill and the plain of the northern hill (Bard, 402)
		 . The northern hill is the location of a cemetery, while the southern hill is the location 
		 of the Temple of Hathor.</p>
		 <p>Similar to other settlements at the time, Gebelein’s close location to the Nile River 
		 provided the necessary resources for the settlement to function. In addition, Gebelein also
		 contains geological minerals that have demonstrated use in Gebelein's past. One such example
		 is limestone, which was used to carve stela found in and around the Temple of Hathor. 
		 Another example is the amount of sand around Gebelein, which allowed the human remains 
		 buried on the northern hill to dry out instead of decomposing.</p>

		 <br>
		 <h3>Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Although Gebelein was mentioned in D’escription de L’Egypte in the early 1800s, first 
		 excavations began near the end of the nineteenth century. Wallis Budge, an Egyptologist for
		 the British Museum, stated in By Nile and Tigris, “In the greater number of tombs from 
		 which [pre-dynastic antiquities] came, the human remains were much broken, and generally 
		 speaking, not worth removing”. (Budge, 359). Thus, early expeditions resulted in the 
		 valuable finds that encouraged further excavation in hopes of adding to the growing Ancient
		 Egyptian collection at the British Museum.</p>
		 <p>Early excavators of Gebelein included the French, with Gaston Maspero starting 
		 excavations in 1884. His investigations were followed by his fellow Frenchmen, Eugène 
		 Grébaut and Georges Daressy in 1891. And subsequently Jacques de Morgan and Georges Foucart
		 in 1893. Jacques de Morgan returned for more investigations in 1900. Eight years later, 
		 Louis Lortet and Claude Gaillard investigated the site. The Egyptian Exploration Fund also 
		 sent G. W. Fraser and M. W. Blackden in 1893 to excavate Gebelein. In the early twentieth 
		 century, the Egyptian Musuem in Turin, Italy send Ernesto Schiaparellis, who would conduct 
		 a series of excavations from 1910 to 1920, followed by his successor, Giulio Farina from 
		 1930 to 1937 (Bard, 403).</p>
		 <p>The cemeteries located on the northern hill contained mummies and grave goods from the 
		 pre-dynastic era, particularly the fourth millennium BC. Early excavations of these 
		 cemeteries were focused on finding artifacts and human remains that could potentially be 
		 used for exhibition in the British Museum. Preliminary searches yielded only fragmented 
		 remains, however, further investigation due to information from a Gebelein native resulted 
		 in the discovery of complete sets of human remains. These remains were buried in shallow 
		 graves with assorted grave goods such as pots and flints (Budge, 360). One of the most 
		 famous of these remains is a naturally mummified male – dubbed “Ginger” due to his red 
		 hair – who remains at the British Museum today. The mummified male was found buried in a 
		 contracted, fetal-like position – similar to other contemporary burials and covered 
		 directly with earth (most likely sand), resulting in the natural mummification (The British
		 Museum). Although the mummified male was discovered over a century ago, research is still 
		 being conducted on the mummy. In particular, an analytical request regarding the light 
		 levels in the showcase was proposed, as it was believed that the level of light could 
		 damage the mummy. Results influenced not only the lowering of light in the mummy’s 
		 showcase, but for the whole gallery, in order to protect and preserve the artifacts (The 
		 British Museum) Gebelein is also the source of artifacts from the later periods of Ancient 
		 Egyptian history. Aquisitioned in 1931, a round-topped limestone stela depicts Wedjat eyes,
		 two rows of hieroglyphic text, and a depiction of a deceased holding a lotus flower (The 
		 British Museum). The hieroglyphic inscription translates to “Guard of the Phyle of Hathor” 
		 and “Lady of Gebelein” (The British Museum). <img src="http://classwiki.matrix.msu.edu/images/2/23/G_-_stela.jpg" align="right"> This stela was dated to be a remnant of the 
		 Second Intermediate or Middle Kingdom era – approximately 1500 – 2000 years later than the 
		 pre-dynastic mummies discovered in the northern hill necropolis. The stela is just one of 
		 the many artifacts associated with the dynastic era of Ancient Egypt in Gebelein. During 
		 the early twentieth century, Ernesto Schiaparelli led a group of Italian archaeologists in 
		 the excavation of Gebelein, and in particular, the Temple of Hathor. Bard described the 
		 temple as, “located on the southern hill close to the Nile, where a manmade cave was 
		 excavated in a ‘T’ plan, consisting of a hall and a sanctuary (Bard, 402). Other artifacts 
		 found at the temple include royal stelae from the second and third dynasties (early 
		 dynastic and old kingdom), wall fragments depicting royalty from the eleventh, thirteenth, 
		 and fifteenth dynasties (Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period), and a wall of mud 
		 bricks form the late pharaonic era (Oxford Reference) (Bard, 402). Furthermore, Gebelein 
		 proved to be a sight with artistic significance. <img src="http://classwiki.matrix.msu.edu/images/d/db/G_-_figurines.jpg" align="left"> Various figurines including one of a bearded man, 
		 and wooden models of boats were discovered and dated to the pre-dynastic era and the First 
		 Intermediate Period, respectively (Bard, 403). Furthermore, a group of sarcophogai dating 
		 to the First Intermediate Period was also found. These sarcophogai featured illustrations 
		 and painting of scenes (Bard, 403). Examples of literature and education are exemplified 
		 in papyri consisting of administrative texts found in Fourth Dynasty graves (Bard, 404). 
		 These finds illustrate the significance of Gebelein over time, and not during one specific 
		 period. In addition, the hieroglyphics on the stelae and the papyri and creation of the 
		 temple can give insight into the education and technology of the Gebelein community during 
		 the dynastic era.</p> 
		 <p>Lastly, Schiaparelli also discovered a sixth-dynasty tomb consisting of a linen dress in
		 the necropolis on the northern hill. The “Turin dress” was discovered along with other 
		 grave objects such as a wooden head-rest, a stone vase, and a decayed pair of leather 
		 sandals. Unfortunately, due to lost records, the location of the latter three objects is 
		 currently unknown (Hall and Pedrini, 136). Hall and Pedrini discuss the dress in great 
		 detail in their article, explaining how the dress is made up of three separate parts and 
		 held together by strings. Furthermore, inferences are made in regards to the use of the 
		 dress – a lack of pleating and appearance of possible perspiration suggest that the garment
		 was worn during the individual’s lifetime and not just used for funerary purposes (Hall and
		 Pedrini, 138). Fiber analysis of the dress was also taken, and the results concluded that 
		 materials used in the dress included bast fibers and flax or hemp (Hall and Pedrini, 138). 
		 Furthermore, the Turin dress was compared to dresses found in a First Intermediate Period 
		 cemetery at Naga ed-Dêr. Although the Turin dress is only one artifact and much of its 
		 context is unknown, analysis of the design and materials concluded that the dress was most 
		 likely worn by a woman, but the dress was also an anomaly, possibly caused by differences 
		 in the regional climate between Gebelein in central Upper Egypt and the location of the 
		 other dresses in the Fayum and northern Upper Egypt.</p>
		 <p>Although excavated materials such as the linen dress and the mummified male remains with
		 ginger-colored hair are still articles of inquiry in recent scholarship, as of late, little
		 excavation has been done at Gebelein. However, the site on the northern hill where the 
		 cemetery is located has only been partially investigated, and this necropolis has the 
		 potential for future discoveries should excavations at Gebelein be resumed. Research has 
		 demonstrated the significance of Gebelein from the pre-dynastic period to at least the 
		 Middle Kingdom era, exhibited through the discoveries of pre-dynastic mummies and the 
		 Temple of Hathor. Nevertheless, archaeological data collecting is still going on in 
		 Gebelein. As of 1999, attempts to accurately map Gebelein were taking place (Bard, 403). 
		 Thus, recent scholarship of Gebelein has focused on the analysis of already-excavated 
		 materials opposed to the propositions of new excavations at the site.</p>

		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>As one of the original sites discovered during the Napoleonic expeditions, and the 
		 location of many excavations over the past century, Gebelein not only represents Ancient 
		 Egyptian history, but also the history of archaeological discovery. Originally seen as a 
		 potential source for antiquities intended to be put on display at the British Museum, 
		 Gebelein now also represents the influence Europe – in particular to Gebelein: France, 
		 England, and Italy – had upon the discovery of Ancient Egyptian artifacts. These 
		 discoveries led to public awareness, which ultimately resulted in not only the collecting 
		 of Ancient Egyptian artifacts, but also the study of Ancient Egyptian life and culture.</p>
