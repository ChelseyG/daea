         <p>The images to the right are snapshots of advertisements placed by Frederick R. Page and Homer Joslyn, for events taking place in the Market House. These ads ran in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of 30th and 31st August, 1865.</p>		

		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The Market-House of 1865 stood on the aptly-named Market House Hill and was part of a complex which housed both the market-house and the court-house. The History of Market House Hill is a testament to the fact that fire played an important role in shaping the architectural and structural development of St. John's during the course of the 19th century.  The first building on this location was the 1730 courthouse, a wooden structure which was rebuilt in 1831 due to age and decay. This second building was destroyed in the fire of 1846, and in 1859 was replaced by the dual market-house and court-house structure which is the subject of this discussion. This building was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1892, after which the site was abandoned and the houses moved to a different location.  In 1899, a new court-house was built on the original site of Market House Hill, and this structure stands to this day, retaining its original function as St. John's Courthouse, at 194 Water Street.</p>

         <p>In 1862, Winton left the <i>Daily News</i> and published another newspaper, the <i>Day Book</i>, which he renamed the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> in 1865. The <i>Chronicle</i> became St. John's principle anti-confederate newspaper, and the mouthpiece for Winton's disapproval of the prevelance of religious opinion in political matters.  In 1869, Winton ran for one term as the elected anti-confederate representative in the riding of Bonavista.</p>
