      <h1>Kom Ombo</h1>
         <h3>First Dynasty to the Coptic Period</h3>
<h4>By: Morgann Brafford</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The beginning looks into Kom Ombo uncovered archaeological material from the First Dynasty through the Coptic Period. 
		 The Kom Ombo basin was clearly occupied throughout those time periods. The most significant discovery on the site was the 
		 Temple of Kom Ombo. This temple, on top of being relatively well preserved, is also special because it is dually dedicated 
		 to the gods Sobek and Horus. It is one of the few temples divided in half with one side in worship of a deity and the other 
		 parallel half being dedicated to another. Also found within the site were remnants of ancient caravan routes, New Kingdom 
		 blocks, and well preserved reliefs. Jacques de Morgan in 1893 and Edmun Vignard in the 1920’s were two of the prominent 
		 excavators and researchers of Kom Ombo and the temple. Morgan primarily cleared the temple of debris, and Vignard 
		 discovered important prehistoric sites. </p>
		 <p>The first real excavation into Kom Ombo began in 1799 by a group of French archaeologists. Serious excavations into the 
		 site however did not begin until 1828 when Champollion visited and discovered an Eighteenth Dynasty gateway. Several years 
		 later, around 1893, Jacques de Morgan made his appearance in the region as well and uncovered both halves of the temple – 
		 the half dedicated to Horus the falcon god and the half dedicated to Sobek the crocodile god and cleared the temple of debris.
		 Much later, in the 1920’s Edmun Vignard discovered flint tools not of Egyptian origin on the site. </p>

		 <p>Kom Ombo is roughly 800 kilometers south of Cairo, in the province of Markaz in Upper Egypt. It is forty kilometers north 
		 of Aswan and fifty kilometers south of Edfu. Besides the city of Aswan itself, it is one of the farthest most south ancient 
		 sites along the Nile in Egypt. The modern population of Kom Ombo is composed of Nubians who relocated here after the building 
		 of the Aswan Dam and Lake Nasser, created to help control the annual inundation, encroached on their home. Most of these 
		 families support themselves by farming sugar cane. Temperatures in Kom Ombo stay pretty stable being a site placed near the 
		 desert with temperatures averaging near the sixties in the winter months and near the nineties in the summer months. There is 
		 not much rainfall happening in the area, most occurring during the months of April and June, so most of the year the area is 
		 dry and very sandy, only receiving its moisture from the Nile and irrigation. </p>
		 <p>Much of the site of Kom Ombo is composed of very interesting strata. Surprisingly enough, this strata contains Eocene and 
		 cretaceous rocks. These Eocene era rocks are actually sea-urchins that are present in the low ridges at the northern ridges of 
		 the plains in the site, while the Cretaceous limestone is more contained to the east. Within this cretaceous limestone are 
		 oysters that have been also found in the Wadi Allowi on the more southern side of the plain in Kom Ombo. </p>

	<h3>Site Description</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Standing on the site, there are several prominent structures. The largest of these is the dual sided Temple of Horus and Sobek. 
	This huge temple is complete with interior and exterior walls, columns, many hypostyle halls, sanctuaries, altars, courts, 
	colonnades, pools (for crocodile raising, coinciding with beliefs that this would protect against crocodile attacks), a large 
	entrance – all in double with exact replicas on each side of the temple. Each side of the temple has its own representations 
	carved in to it – one side illustrating scenes of Horus and his wife Hathor  (also along with their son Khonsu) and the other 
	Sobek and his mistress Ta-Sent-Nefer (which is strangely just another form of Hathor). The entrance to the building is through 
	a large arch, or gate, which opened into a large open court with pylons. A giant hall decorated with huge pillars decorated with 
	scenes of the gods and the sun, as well as floral designs and dedications to the Pharaoh and his family are the main tourist 
	attraction within the temple itself. This hall, along with another smaller hall covered in reliefs of the gods and Ptolemy, 
	are one of the few monuments still in good condition as most of the surrounding temple has been half-destroyed over time. The 
	temple started out small originally but was gradually added on to by other pharaohs, like Ptolemy XIII, as well as the Roman 
	emperor Trajan.</p>
	<p>Just to the south of the main body of the temple is a Roman temple from the Coptic period. It is a chapel worshipping Het-Heru 
	(or Hathor). It was used to house a large college of mummified crocodiles that came from a relatively close cemetery. Also just 
	outside the temple, close to the largest main pylon, is the remnants of the birth house (also known as the Mammisi). These were 
	believed to be where Het-Heru was born. On the outer wall of the temple was also found a carved chest of medical instruments like 
	knives, shears, saws, probes, spatulas, forceps, and hooks.  </p>

	<p>Kom Ombo was an important stop on a major caravan route throughout Egypt. It also laid on the route for the gold mines as 
	well. The main part of the site was mostly created and expanded during the Ptolemaic era, during the reign of Pharaoh Ptolemy 
	IV, dating to about 180 BC.  The site was gradually and continuously added on to by other pharaohs in the following centuries 
	– each who wanted to add their own names or own histories to the site. </p>

		 <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The first survey at Kom Ombo was conducted in 1799 by a team of French archaeologists who had come over with Napoleon 
		 when he invaded ancient Egypt. When Napoleon had planned his trip into Egypt, he brought with him one hundred and sixty 
		 seven scholars of various types to study the artifacts and art that they would discover along their way. This group was 
		 named the Commission Des Sciences et Des Arts. This body produced the Description de l’Egypte, which in great detail 
		 described Egypt. While this group did not really do much excavation at Kom Ombo, they did detail many of its relics in 
		 their text.</p>

		 Society. Flickr.">Image 4</a></figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>The site fell back into disinterest and not much happened at it for quite a long period of time. However in 1828, 
		 Champollion visited the site and discovered an Eighteenth Dynasty gateway. This discovery re-fostered interest in the site, 
		 and many more archaeologists soon visited it. In 1893, Jacques de Morgan uncovered the Temple of Horus and Sobek. He excavated 
		 both sides of the temple and was the first to realize how unique it was. While he was the first to excavate there, he would 
		 not be the last for this is the main draw of the Kom Ombo region that has seen hundreds of interested archaeologists and 
		 thousands of fascinated tourists since its discovery. </p>
		 <p>More recent excavations occurred in the 1960’s (specifically around 1962-1963) and uncovered most prehistoric and early 
		 Egyptian works at the edge of the Kom Ombo plains at a site called New Qurta. On the sandstone cliffs that run on the edges 
		 of the site, a significant amount of carved petroglyphs were found. These illustrated cattle and other similar animals 
		 (hippopotami, fish, gazelles, etc.). It was surprising to researchers to find any evidence of human influence that survived 
		 for the area had been heavily quarried for thousands of years. The site was studied by archaeologists from Brussels, like 
		 Edmun Vignard, who discovered that the site was Paleolithic and uncovered not only the petroglyphs, but stone tools and the 
		 bones of butchered animals, like wild cattle and hippopotami. These artifacts were dated to about 15,000 years. They believe 
		 that these remains discovered are the only ones still existing for the Nubians urbanized the area after they were displaced 
		 by Lake Nasser. </p>

		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Kom Ombo is important historically because of the large ancient Egyptian temple dually dedicated to Sobek, the crocodile-headed god 
		 and Horus, the falcon-headed god. This is one of the only temples designed like this in all of ancient Egypt. It is one of the 
		 only temples that is symmetrical along its main axis, even after being added on to many times. The temple was started by Ptolemy 
		 VI, but it is unclear his motives for the double worship – though it is believed that the Egyptians worshipped crocodiles to help 
		 protect against crocodile attacks. Unfortunately, the temple is in very poor condition Also contained within the site are Roman 
		 Coptic chapels, containing crocodile mummies, and the birth house of Hathor (Het-Heru). All of these discoveries have given 
		 researchers more insight into how the Egyptian people at Kom Ombo worshipped, along with their religious dynamics, and the 
		 changes in religious use of the site and occupation through the many thousands of years it has been occupied.</p>
