The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor L’Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, Christian brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.",<a href="sites/gebel-el-haridi.html">MORE DETAILS</a>

30.993344,29.67846,<h4>Late Period to the Modern Era</h4>,<h3>Marea</h3>,"The discovery and excavation of Marea has led to significant insight into the commercial industry of Egypt before the founding of Alexandria by Alexander the Great. As a harbor town, Marea was essential in exporting and transporting goods and in welcoming pilgrims traveling to Abu Mina. Large drydock jetties and runners made of limestone were created to launch and dock boats and many shops and homes were made to assist the inhabitants and visitors of Marea. F. El-Fakharani, Boston University, Alexandria University, Thomas Boyd and Centre d’Etudes Alexandrines have excavated this well preserved site and reconstructed it in hopes to return it to its original splendor.",<a href="sites/Marea.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
25.719313,32.60134,<h4>New Kingdom: 20th Dynasty-9th Century CE</h4>,<h3>Medinet Habu</h3>,"The excavations done at the city of Medinet Habu have led to significant insight into the construction patterns of temples in the area from the 18th Dynasty through the 9th century. As a worship site for the god Amun and the location of the Temple of Ramses III, significant construction took place. Then later with the rise of the Graeco-Roman and Coptic periods, construction continued on top of the ruins of the previous temples. Medinet Habu also functioned as a refugee center for striking workers and war refugees. The Service de Conservation des Monuments de l’Egypte, Service des Antiquites, and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago excavated and reconstructed Medinet Habu back to its original beauty.",<a href="sites/medinet-habu.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
31.21,27.14,<h4>Thirteenth Century BC-Graeco-Roman Period/Modern</h4>,<h3>Marsa Matruh</h3>,"The excavations done at the site of Marsa Matruh have led to significant insight into the trade patterns of the Mediterranean. The city of Marsa Matruh is modern, built on top of the ancient city of Paraitonion. Because of modern construction, the site of Paraitonion is destroyed and not accessible for excavations. Due to the fantastic work of the American archaeologist, Oric Bates, a small island near Marsa Matruh was studied in 1913 and 1914. This island was an important stop for mariners traveling across the Mediterranean because the next stops before and after Paraitonion were hundreds of kilometers away. In 1904, the French observer Fourtau originally studied Marsa Matruh and the island. He found similar findings to Bates, which clarifies that the observations are true even though they cannot be physically excavated today.",<a href="sites/marsa-matruh.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
