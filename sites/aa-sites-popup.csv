As a worship site for the god Amun and the location of the Temple of Ramses III, significant construction took place. Then later with the rise of the Graeco-Roman and Coptic periods, construction continued on top of the ruins of the previous temples. Medinet Habu also functioned as a refugee center for striking workers and war refugees.
