The archaeological remains that were discovered illustrate several types of continued occupation at the site. A large stone quarry, rock-cut tombs used as necropolis and an enclosed mud-brick settlement were all found within the boundaries. George Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Nestor L’Hote and Bonomi traveled the Gebel el-Haridi region during the nineteenth century. These men recorded what they saw as they travelled through the region, such as Ptolemaic quarries, Christian brick ruins, tombs, and mutilated statues.",<a href="sites/gebel-el-haridi.html">MORE DETAILS</a>

Instead this site was a center of domestic life consisting of self sustained villages that functioned in time with, like the rest of Egypt, the ebb and flow of the Nile. While this site dates back to the Old Kingdom, a rarity for a city in the Delta, it developed over time and by the New Kingdom it was the capital of the third Nome. "

This temple became the mother goddess’s main cult center and took over the village site. Almost every ruler there after either modified the temple, added their own temple and worship center, or both, and the temple became the main function of the area. (Unknown) The last to modify Mut were the Ptolemies VI and VIII who added a main gate way, partially rebuild the Mut Temple and Temple A, added a healing chapel of the “Great See of Heliopolis,” a Ptolemy VI chapel, two chapels of Monuemhat, and generally combined many the neighboring chapels under one roof. It was under the Ptolemy rule that the site eventually collapsed."
