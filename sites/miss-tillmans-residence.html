		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>This text is a snapshot of the advertisement placed by Miss Tillman which appears in the Morning Chronicle of September 2nd, 1865.  The text at the bottom of the advertisement ("July 26, 3 m.") suggests that the ad first ran on July 26th, and was intended to run for three months.</p>

		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The exact location of Miss Tillman's residence cannot be definitively established.  The layout of roads in St. John's seems to have remained relatively unchanged over the decades, as can be seen from the juxtaposition of the St. John's 1893 map and the very recent Stamen Toner Map.  However, while the position of Cochrane Street seems much the same as it was in the 1800s, the separation of the street into numbered units in the year of 1865 is unknown. For this reason, I have used the modern (2015) location of 16 Cochrane Street, following the coordinates supplied by Googlemaps.  Although this is probably far from accurate, the original building is no longer extant, most likely having succombed to the Great Fire of 1892, which destroyed much of the downtown core of St. John's.  For this reason, the modern location of 16 Cochrane Street is the only readily-available option for pinpointing the original location.</p>

         <p>References to Miss Tillman and to 16 Cochrane Street were extremely slim. There is, in fact, only one that could be found. Hutchinson's Newfoundland Directory of 1864-1865, which lists businesses and merchants and their addresses, lists a Miss Mary Tillman as the proprietress of a variety store at 204 Water Street.  The entry also lists 16 Cochrane Street, which--given the information provided in her advertisement in the Morning Chronicle--can be definitively identified as her personal residence.</p>
         <p>It is interesting to note that there was relatively little information to be found on Mary Tillman, compared to other merchants. This is likely due to her gender.  Many of the names of other (male) merchants can be found in a variety of sources, including biographies of important Canadian figures as well as lists of professional and political membership.  Many merchants in St. John's in the 1800s also had secondary careers as politicans, and these facts mean that the social exposure of these men would have been far higher than would be that of a woman shop-keeper, particularly an unmarried one, and helps explain the greater number of historical documents in which their names can be found.</p>
         <p> Mary Tillman's in one of only three obviously feminine names in the newspapers, and of these the only name on which any type of additional information could be found.  This is probably becase of her relatively unusual position as a female business owner in her own right.  If she remained unmarried and childless her whole life, that could also explain why no marriage records--or records indicating the birth of her children--could be found.  On the other hand, many such records from that time are simply no longer extant, and so it is impossibly to make a definitive statement on that matter.</p>
