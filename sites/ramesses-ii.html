<h2>Ramesses II Temple at Abydos Layout</h2>

</html>

		 <p>The first pylon and Forecourt that were once the entrance to the site are no longer standing, but the evidence remaining shows there were once red-granite statues and red granite door frames. In the Forecourt there are also remains of stairs leading to a Heb-Seb Chapel off the Southeast wall of the court.</p>
		 <p>The entrance used by tourists today is the second pylon. There is a badly damaged facing stone that bears a few figures and inscriptions as well as two flagstaff grooves on either side of the pylon. The Open Court through the second pylon contains eighteen sandstone Osiride statues of Ramses along the Southeast , northeast, and northwest walls as well as scenes.The southeast wall contains carvings of a chariot; offerings; sacrificial animals; Egyptian, Asiatic,and Libyan soldiers; and priest and officials. There are also inscriptions on the lower portion of the wall from later periods. Opposite that on the northwest wall is a depiction of an offering procession of crowds of people, animals, etc. moving towards the southwest portico. The upper portion of this wall also shows evidence of speeches made by Ramses II. On the southwest wall across from the second pylon there are scenes of offering bearers with bulls, oryxes and gazelles, a chariot, courtiers, soldiers, and foreigners as well as three stairways leading to an elevated portico.</p>
		 <p>The portico contains sixteen pillars in total facing the Open court; a row of eight squared, and eight Osiride columns which once supported a roof.The southeast and northwest walls contain images of Nubian prisoners of war and Asiatic captives. The southwest wall of the portico is broken up by an entrance to the First Octostyle Court as well as two doorways on either side of the entrance leading to shrine chambers. The height of the temples original walls can be estimated by the stone walls between these doorways bearing images of Ramesses II making offerings. Above those images at the top of the damaged walls are also images presumed to be of Ramesses II feet. By using the full images of Ramesses II below the height has been estimated to over eight meter or twenty-four feet. The four shrine chambers were dedicated to different deities. The chamber on the far southeast side of the back wall was dedicated primarily to Seti I with Osiris, Hathor, and Ramesses II and also contained part of a kings list which is now in the British Museum, as well as Seti I barque (royal boat). The chamber right of that contains Rameses II and Seti I with Osiris and Horus. The far northwest chamber is dedicated to Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and to the left of that is a chamber dedicated to Ramses II with Osiris, Thoth, and Horus, with Rameses barque.</p>

		 <p>Through the entrance on the center of the southwest wall of the portico is the First Ocostyle Court bordered with black granite door frames. The court contains eight sandstone pillars to support the roof that was once there. The images of the court show evidence that the temple began being built during the reign of Seti I and was completed during Ramesses II reign. Off the west corner of the court is a shrine bearing images of Ramesses II making offerings to Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Opposite that off the south corner is a stairway that used to lead to the roof. </p>
		 <p>Southwest of the First Octostyle court is the entrance to the Second Octostyle Court that also contains eight supporting pillars. Off the Second Octostyle Court are nine rooms. Three rooms off the southeast wall are dedicated to Osiris, Horus, Amen and Amenti, Isis, Ptah, Sekhet, and Khem. Opposite those rooms off the northwest wall the three rooms are dedicated to Thoth, Osiris, Horus, Haket, Isis, Harsaiset, and Aperu.Through the southwest rooms on either side of the court are two additional rooms with nine decorated niches, and two pillars in each. The three rooms off the southwest wall of the court are three cult shrines. The shrine on the far left was dedicated to Horus, the shrine to the far right was dedicated to Isis, and the center shrine was dedicated to Osiris and is often called the “Alabaster Shrine,” although it is made from white limestone. The Alabaster Shrine once held a statue of five figures of which only two have been officially identified, Osiris, and Horus.</p>
