            <h1>Office of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i></h1>
      <h3>Corner of Duckworth St. and Cathedral St.</h3>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
		 <h3>Original Text</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The image to the right is a snapshot of the editorial text which appeared as the introduction in every issue of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> between August 30th and September 2nd, 1865.</p>		
		 <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The building which housed the office of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> is no longer extant, and the corners of Duckworth and Cathedral streets currently house buildings that were all built after the fire of 1892.  This suggests that the original building was probably destroyed in that fire, if not before. The exact location of this building is therefore unknown, beyond its location on one of the corners where these two streets meet.</p>
         <br>
         <h3>Research</h3>
         <p>While little can be said of the original building of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, more can be said of Francis Winton, the man who created, edited and published the paper. Born around 1829 in St. John's, Winton began his publisher career with the <i>St.John's Daily News</i> in 1860, which he ran with his brother Robert. In 1862, Winton left the <i>Daily News</i> and published another newspaper, the <i>Day Book</i>, which he renamed the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>in 1865. The <i>Chronicle</i> became St. John's principle anti-confederate newspaper, and the mouthpiece for Winton's disapproval of the prevelance of religious opinion in political matters.  In 1869, Winton ran for one term as the elected anti-confederate representative in the riding of Bonavista.</p> 
         <p>Winton left St. John's sometime before 1894 for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he ran a paper which was also called the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>. He died in Pittsburgh, within days of the death of his wife, Susan, in 1908.</p>

         <p><b>Professor Danielle</b></p>
         <p>Charles Henry Danielle, known as 'Professor Danielle' was a colourful and eccentric character about whom little is known prior to his arrival in St. John's in 1860.  Born November 1st, 1830 in Baltimore, Maryland, Danielle was a self-advertised 'professor' of the Tarsichorean art and the owner of a successful Chicago dance academy.</p>
         		          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xtina-R/daea/gh-pages/images/danielle2.jpg" style="float:right; padding-left:35px">
         		          <p>After arriving in St. John's, he advertised himself as a dance instructor and costume-maker, and quickly developed a reputation of glamour and mystery. He leased the downtown property known as the Victorian Skating rink, and from there hosted fancy-dress balls and parties, and elaborate carnivals and theatrical productions which show-cased his costumes.  Danielle left St. John's rather suddenly in 1865, following a fire (purportedly started by an enemy) which destroyed the property, including his collection of costumes, which he insured for thousands of dollars.</p>
         		          <p>Danille returned to St. John's on May 30th, 1888, and once again commenced to host his popular carnival and parties. He also ran a successful restaurant on Water Street which was destroyed in the fire of 1892. He died on May 1st, 1902, in the 'Octagon Castle' (his elaborate, eight-side home near Irvine, Newfoundland), and was buried in the Anglican cemetary on the shores of Quidi Vidi Lake.</p>
         <p><b>T.M. Brown</b></p>
         <p>Nothing further could be found on T.M. Brown. While Brown appears to have been a relatively common name in the area, no records fitting the combination of initials and last name of this man could be located.</p>
