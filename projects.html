      <h1>St. John's Micro History Mapping Project</h1>
	  <h4>Christina Ross</h4>
         <h3>Project Overview</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>This project was created as the final assignment for HIST 3907, a course on Data Mining and Visualization, taught by Professor Shawn Graham, at Carleton University. The course tasked students with learning a variety of data mining skills, culminating in the creation and presentation of a term project that visually represented historical data in a digital form.  The project is my attempt at doing so.</p>
		 <p>The St. John's Micro-History Mapping Project provides an in-depth look at some of the places and people mentioned in a small selection of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, a St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, newspaper which ran from 1862-1881.  The four papers used in this project span the period of 30th August, 1865-2nd September, 1865. Each location on the map marks the site of a physical location or address mentioned in these papers, and I have engaged in lengthy historical research in order to procure further information about each of these sites, and any names which are associated with them in the newspapers. Each point on the map is a clickable link with opens into a more detailed discussion of the information I have found about the sites and persons mentioned.</p>
		 <h3>Theory</h3>
		 <p>The intention behind this project was to provide a deeper context and background to the sometimes scant information found in these newspapers. This intention is based on my belief that newspapers--as a method of recording historical information--provide a very specific and rather shallow array of information, that in many instances is not significant or even understandable to a reader removed from the social or historical context of the newspapers. Newspapers recount information that is intended for readers who know something about the society and time in which the newspaper was created. This means that a certain amount of place- and time-specific knowledge on the part of the reader is assumed by the editor(s) and author(s), and so a newspaper read by someone who is removed from the original geographic or temporal context may not make much sense.</p> 
		 <p>The format of a newspaper is intended to present a large amount of data as quickly and efficiently as possible, and is a very specific and in some ways limited method of presenting information. As records of historical data, newspapers provide only a 'bare-bones' type of data, neglecting to provide an adequate amount of background information on a particular topic, <i>because they assume that the reader already has a certain amount of knowledge of the subject</i>.  Once they are removed from the geographic and/or temporal context in which they were created, newspapers can quickly become an obsolete type of historical document, unless they are read by someone who already has a strong understanding of their context.  That is not to say that the <i>content</i> itself is actually obsolete, but the format can make it seem so. This project is in part an attempt to separate content from format, and in doing so, to demonstrate how particular ways in which historical data are formatted or recorded can greatly determined the ways in which that information is perceived, and the assumed or actual usefulness of that data over time.</p>
		 <p>Finally, this project is an attempt to bring to life--in some small way--a time and place which was no less important to those living in it, even if the document which recorded those places, events and persons can no longer do them justice.  The study of history is, after all, part of what we call the 'humanities', and so this project is an attempt to bring some humanity and a deeper context to a collection of historical newspapers that may otherwise have lost the sense of connection to real people and real places over time.</p>
		 <h3>Format</h3>
		 <p>One of the tasks of the digital historian is to separate content from format, and in doing so, to allow the viewer or reader to understand the data in a new light.  With this comes a remarkable responsibility, for the format of historical data greatly determines how that data is perceived.  The format of historical newspapers is a very specific format, and one that encourages the perception of the information as dry historical facts that are far removed from the reality of the real people, places and events therein.  My intention with this project has been to create a deeper, detailed, and more intimate reading of such historical data, and to create a sense of space and place in a way that is certainly not possible in the format of a newspaper.  My choice of a map and a database format is intended to provide a sense of real place and space, and in so doing, encourage the viewer to perceive the events and people mentioned in the newspaper as real physical places and real, flesh-and-blood people (which they are), rather than as abstract or dull historical facts.</p>
		 <h3>Method and Research</h3>
		 <p></p>
		 <h3>Things that Didn't Work Out the Way I Wanted Them to</h3>
		 <p>One of the delights of digital history is the fact that one is allowed to make mistakes, experience abject failure, and actually learn from such setbacks.  One of the biggest disappointments of this project is one that stemmed from a rather foolish assumption on my part: I had assumed (or wanted to believe, perhaps) that researching the people and events of a relatively small-town historical newspaper would allow me to move away from a 'Great Men' style of history-telling and come closer to a 'real-folks' or social history type of format.  To the extent that the political figures of prestigious citizen of 19th-century Newfoundland are probably relatively unknow to historians who do not special in Canadian Maritime history, I have succeeded in this.  However, as my hope was to in some sense honour the 'everyday' people, places and events that often fall outside of the history books, I feel that I have in some ways failed, particularly in avoiding retelling history in a very gendered fashion.  One of my hopes was to focus not just on locally prestigious St. John's men, but that announcements of births, deaths, marriages and local events would allow me to tell some women's stories, too.  Unfortunately, the newspapers in question--spanning four days worth of news in a city that at the time, had a population of around ten-thousand people--had only three obviously feminine names in them. Of these three, I could find further information on only one, and that because she was apparently a single woman, and a shop-keeper to boot. The majority of men mentioned in the papers were the names of business and/or politicians, that is, locally-prestigious figures with considerable access to social and economic resources.  In this way, I feel that I had failed in one of my intentions, because the historical documents around which my research evolved are dominated by the names and news of powerful men, just as are the majority of history books.  My assumption that a relatively small-town historical newspaper would include mention of events other factions of society was sorely misplaced.  Clearly, this is again a case of 'the winners write the history books', or rather, those with access to financial and social resources (in this case, predominantly white English-speaking men) have the ability to metaphorically write themselves into historical documents in a way that those without access to those resources (in this case, anyone other than white English-speaking men) do not.  In this particular manner, I feel that this project has simply told a different, more localized version of "Great Men'-type history all over again. </p>
