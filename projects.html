      <h1>St. John's Micro History Mapping Project</h1>
	  <h4>Christina Ross</h4>
         <h3>Project Overview</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>This project was created as the final assignment for HIST 3907, a course on Data Mining and Visualization, taught by Professor Shawn Graham, at Carleton University. The course tasked students with learning a variety of data mining skills, culminating in the creation and presentation of a term project that visually represented historical data in a digital form.  The project is my attempt at doing so.</p>
		 <p>The St. John's Micro-History Mapping Project provides an in-depth look at some of the places and people mentioned in a small selection of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, a St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, newspaper which ran from 1862-1881.  The four papers used in this project span the period of 30th August, 1865-2nd September, 1865. Each location on the map marks the site of a physical location or address mentioned in these papers, and I have engaged in lengthy historical research in order to procure further information about each of these sites, and any names which are associated with them in the newspapers. Each point on the map is a clickable link with opens into a more detailed discussion of the information I have found about the sites and persons mentioned.</p>
		 <h3>Theory and Context</h3>
		 <p>The intention behind this project was to provide a deeper context and background to the sometimes scant information found in these newspapers. This intention is based on my belief that newspapers--as a method of recording historical information--provide a very specific and rather shallow array of information, that in many instances is not significant or even understandable to a reader removed from the social or historical context of the newspapers. Newspapers recount information that is intended for readers who know something about the society and time in which the newspaper was created. This means that a certain amount of place- and time-specific knowledge on the part of the reader is assumed by the editor(s) and author(s), and so a newspaper read by someone who is removed from the original geographic or temporal context may not make much sense.</p> 
		 <p>The format of a newspaper is intended to present a large amount of data as quickly and efficiently as possible, and is a very specific and in some ways limited method of presenting information. As records of historical data, newspapers provide only a 'bare-bones' type of data, neglecting to provide an appropriate amont of background information on a particular topic, <i>because they assume that the reader already has a certain amount of knowledge of the subject</i>.  This fact means that newspapers can become an obsolete type of historical record very quickly, once they are removed from the geographic and/or temporal context in which they were created.  That is not to say that the <i>content</i> itself is actually obsolete, but the format can make it seem so. This project is in part an attempt to separate content from format, and in doing so, to demonstrate how particular ways in which historical data are formatted or recorded can greatly determined the ways in which that information is perceived, and the assumed or actual usefulness of that data over time.</p>
		 <p>Finally, this project is an attempt to bring to life--in some small way--a time and place which was no less important to those living in it, even if the events and persons recorded in the document representing that time and place can no longer do it justice.  The study of history is, after all, part of what we call the 'humanities', and so this project is an attempt to bring some humanity and a deeper context to a collection of historical newspapers that otherwise can lose the sense of connection to real people and real places over time.</p>
